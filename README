Understanding and Using nagd.pl and nagc.pl
-------------------------------------------


SUMMARY:

nagd.pl and nagc.pl are a daemon and client system for monitoring 
network status via Nagios and Asterisk.  When Nagios sends an 
unacceptable amount of problem notifications, Asterisk can respond 
by placing a call to the administrator's phone, using eSpeak.


-------------------------------------------


USAGE:

nagd.pl should run constantly on your Asterisk machine, 
waiting for and handling input from Nagios.

nagc.pl should reside on your Nagios machine, and be 
executed each time a new notification occurs.

:IMPORTANT: 
-----------
Please see commands.cfg.example and contacts_nagios2.cfg.example,
as these need to be applied to your Nagios machine.
